To prevent CS8600 warning, a question mark was added next to "string" keyword by benefiting a Reddit answer [1].
A method for taking 2 numbers from result of "Console.ReadLine", which is using "Split", was found in a Stack Overflow webpage [2].
"FormatException" phrase was found in a webpage of Stack Overflow, for using in "try-catch" statements [3].
Default value of a bool type variable, was learnt in Microsoft documentation [4].
Any other keywords which are related to "try-catch", could not be found in a document of Microsoft [5].
It was noticed that IDE0059 warning showed an unnecessary assignment but its actual reason could not be understood in Microsoft documentation [5].
While trying to find a solution for "CS0136" warning, it was learnt that scopes of variables in a "case" of "switch", correspond to the whole "switch" statement, from an answer in Stack Overflow [8].
Another explanation about previous problem, was found a webpage [9].
New brackets were added into case statements for solving previous problem.
A custom exception decleration method for Java, was found in a webpage [10] but it was not used and instead of that, "throw new FormatException" statement was used.
For previous sentence "statement" word was used instead of "phrase" word by benefiting a Wikipedia webpage [11].
"Trim" method was found on a wepbage [12] and it was used for removing whitespaces from an input text.
"Reverse" method was found in another webpage [13] and it was used for reversing sorted "list".
Thanks to CA1806 warning, it was learnt that "Trim" method returns something and method should not be used without being assigned.
Tasks of a subject [14] Patika.dev tutorial, were completed.
