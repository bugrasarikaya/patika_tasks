After reading a task [1] of Patika.dev, "oop" folder was created.
A website [2] was chosen for drawing UML diagram online.
It was learnt that UML and class diagram, are nearly same things, on a webpage [3].
A class diagram image [4] in lesson, was examined because its subject is same as task's subject.
Multiplicity term with its notation, was found in a webage [5] but it could not be implemented on online editor, easily.
Multiplicity notations were not added on every associations because their necessity could not be found on internet.
Drawn class diagram was exported as PNG format.
