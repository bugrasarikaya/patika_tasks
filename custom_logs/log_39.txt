Third task [1] of a Patike.dev course, was read.
For drawing a filled circle, solutions were searched on internet and one program [2] was thought that its "if" statement's condition is similar to circle formula
Two webpages [3] [4] were examined shortly for learning difference between "Parse" and "TryParse".
"Math.Pow" method which is used in calculations of exponantial numbers, was found in a webpage [5].
Equation formula of circle, was examined on a webpage [6].
Drawn circle was not as expected because of high vertical difference of characters of console screen.
Ellipse formula was found in a webpage [7].
An circle was drawn but its right and left sides did not become equal to its top and down sides.
