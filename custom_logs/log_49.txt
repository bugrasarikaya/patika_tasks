Thirteenth task [1] of a Patika.dev course, was read.
A project [2] about the task, was examined.
"using BarcodeLib;" line from the project, was searched and a tutorial [3] about Barcodelib NuGet package was found.
Code which has "UPC-A" title, was used and a barcode as PNG format, was generated but a method for scanning could not be found.
"ZXing.Net" NuGet package was installed but it could not be used.
IronBarcode (BarCode) NuGet package was found in a webpage [4] and it was installed.
After installation CA1416 warning occured and it was suppressed by applying a suggestion of Visual Studio.
"IronSoftware.Exceptions.LicensingException" exception occured because of missing license.
Aspose.BarCode was found in NuGet Package Manager and after installation, its example code from its URL [5], was used to read barcode but last 4 digits of barcode, could not be read because of missing license.
Any research did not implemented for finding a new free barcode reader.
It was noticed that Git did not track generated barcode image and thanks to relavite path notation whose examples were examine on two webpages [6] [7], file was saved in a top level folder.
Previous modification was applied on previous project.
