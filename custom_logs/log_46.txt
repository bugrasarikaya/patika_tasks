Tenth task [1] of a Patika.dev course, was read.
"implicitly typed array" term was learnt on a document of Microsoft [2].
A document about "upper case" term was found in a webpage [3] and it was decided to use "upper case" term as unified on variable names.
While benefiting an old task code [4], a problem was noticed and it was fixed.
"ToCharArray" method was found in a webpage [5] and it was used.
2 webpages [6] [7] about difference between "Count" and "Length" members, were examined and it was learnt that "Length" is better.
