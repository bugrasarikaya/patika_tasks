After examining a webpage [1] of the course, "task_3" project was created.
To write task project, code lines of previous course webpages [2] [3], were copied.
A shared project [4] was benefited.
Validation code lines for "Update" and "GetById" methods, were written.
Validation code lines for "Delete" method was not written because it had been written already before in course [3] video.
