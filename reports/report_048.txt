Twelfth task [1] of a Patika.dev course, was read.
Method of adding trailing zeros, which is using "ToString("N2")", was learnt on a webpage [2].
ATM options were examined on a webpage [3].
"deposit" and "withdraw" words were validated after examining a post in a webpage [4].
Difference between "withdraw" and "withdrawal" words were examined on a webpage [5].
Writing an reading methods for text file, were examined on two sources [6] [7].
Examples about date and time, were examined on four sources [8] [9] [10] [11].
Examples of "File.AppendText" method, were examined on two sources [12] [13] but instead of that, "File.AppendAllTextAsync" method which was found in suggestions of Visual Studio, was used.
"accessed the system" statement was used after a small googling.
It was found only a performance issue between Async and Non-Async methods on a webpage [14] and any difference could not ne found between "File.AppendAllTextAsync" or "File.AppendAllText" methods while testing.
Because "File.ReadAllTextAsync" method gave an unwanted result, all writing and reading methods were implemented non-asynchronously by removing "async" statement.
