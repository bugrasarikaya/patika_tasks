Second task screenshot was saved into "task_instructions" folder.
An empty ASP.NET Core Web API project whose name is "task_2", was created and its .NET version was 7.0.
Previous task code was copied to new project.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch (v7.0.2), Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson (v7.0.2), Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (v7.0.2) and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (v7.0.2) NuGet packages were installed.
A video [1] about SOLID, was watched.
"task_final" project was removed.
A webpage about dependency injection [2], was read.
After examining 5 webpages [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] about repository pattern, using repository pattern, was decided because it supports SOLID.
For Visual Studio, multiple selection shortcut which is "CTRL + ALT + Left Click", was remembered on a webpage [8].
"IEmployeeRepository" and "EmployeeRepository" classes was created into created "Repository" folder.
"context.Employees.OrderBy(e => EF.Property<object>(e, orderby)).ToList();" statement was written by benefiting an advice from previous task's responses.
"AddScoped" extension method was used in "Program.cs" file because its usage was suggested in an examined video [6].
"migration_0" migration was applied on "npt2_db" database.
By benefiting two sources [9] [10], a code was tried to be written for checking given argument with column of table.
"typeof()" statement could not be used with "context.Employees" statement and to resolve it, "GetType" method was used by examining a research result [11].
A non-controller class was created into "NonController" folder and a string converter method was created by benefiting two sourcecs [12] [13].
An interface class created for created string converter class but after changing its method to an extension method by benefiting a webpage [14], CS0714 error occurred because of using a static class to implement an interface and crated interface was removed.
It was understood that "typeof()" and "GetType" statements were used incorrectly and after examining a webpage [15], "typeof(Employee)" was used instead of "context.Employees.GetType()" statement, while getting column names of model.
Code of checking column name, was moved into a created extension method.
A tutorial webpage [16] about fake REST API, was read.
A video [17] about unit test, was watched.
9 webpages [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] about logging, were examined.
4 webpages [27] [28] [29] [30] about creating custom middleware, were examined.
"LoggingMiddleware" middleware class was created for showing accessed action name like in a task instruction.
"try-catch" statement was moved into created "ExceptionMiddleware" middleware.
500 HTTP status code was returned by using "StartAsync" method in custom exception middleware.
"NonController" folder was renamed as "ExtensionMethods".
3 webpages [31] [32] [33] about custom attribute, were examined.
A webpage [34] about reflection, was examined.
A custom attribute about account (user) role, was applied on main controller.
403 Forbidden HTTP status code was learnt on a webpage [35].
By benefiting a code from a webpage [36], custom attribute of controller, was checked with a static value for authentication in another created custom middleware.
Checked value was static because of implementing a fake authentication service.
Database was exported.
If account is not authorized, it responses with 403 status code.
