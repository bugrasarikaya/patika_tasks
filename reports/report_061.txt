An attempt was started to crate additional entities, was started for resolving previous duplicate key issue.
A method was found in a webpage [1] and it was used for retrieving single column value form query.
In a webpage, naming conventions of "id", were examined.
"Count()" method of Linq was found in a webpage [3] and it was used for retrieving query result count.
In a webpage [4], it was learnt that last ID can be retrieved from last added object after using "SaveChanges" method.
Modification of project, was completed.
Thanks to a webpage [5], instead of InlineData, MemberData was used for inserting a List.
Most of all tests, failed when they were runned together and a solution from a webpage [6], was tried to resolve this but it did not work as expected.
While testing unit tests independently, detected bugs were fixed.
Suprisingly creating order operations did not give an error because "[Authorize]" attribute was set to creating order action of order controller.
Unit tests of token operations, were skipped.
