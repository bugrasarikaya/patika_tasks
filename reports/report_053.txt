A webpage [1] of .Net Core lecture, was examined.
Previous "task_01" was removed and an empty ASP.NET Core Web API project was created.

Also a shared task [7] was used to fix missing code lines.
"task_final" project was deleted in file explorer.
"UpdateBook" ve "GetById" method code lines, were written by benefiting written codes by teacher.
