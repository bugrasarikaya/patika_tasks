After reading task webpage [1] and examining previous course webpages, it was understood that teacher still was wanting us to develop same project.
A new xUnit Test Project was created with "task_5" name.
Project development instuctions from a course webpage [2], was started to be applied.
"task_4" project reference was added.
Visual Studio solution was rebuilded.
Changes were applied on "task_4" by following previous course [3] instructions.
Previous course [3] code lines were copied into "task_5" project.
Shared projects [4] [5] were examined to verify "task_5" project.
"When" method was removed from "UpdateGenreCommandValidator" class because it gave error while working on unit testing.
Some failed unit tests were ignored because they gave success after running them individually.
Requested unit tests were completed.
